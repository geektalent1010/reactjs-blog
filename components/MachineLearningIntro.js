    I highly recommend to take the <Link to="https://click.linksynergy.com/link?id=yL1MQRWYyXQ&offerid=467035.1560515719&type=2&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2Flearn%2Fmachine-learning">Machine Learning</Link> course by Andrew Ng. This article will not explain the machine learning algorithms in detail, but only demonstrate their usage in JavaScript. The course on the other hand goes into detail and explains these algorithms in an amazing quality. At this point in time of writing the article, I learn about the topic myself and try to internalize my learnings by writing about them and applying them in JavaScript. If you find any parts for improvements, please reach out in the comments or create a Issue/Pull Request on GitHub.
