The Road to learn React book teaches you the fundamentals of React. You will build a real world application along the way in plain React without complicated tooling. Everything from project setup to deployment on a server will be explained. The book comes with additional referenced reading material and exercises with each chapter. After reading the book, you will be able to build your own applications in React. The material is kept up to date by me, Robin Wieruch, and the community.

In the Road to learn React, I want to offer a foundation before you start to dive into the broader React ecosystem. It has less tooling and less external state management, but a lot of information around React. It explains general concepts, patterns and best practices in a real world React application.

You will learn to build your own Hacker News application. It covers real world features like pagination, client-side caching and interactions like searching and sorting. Additionally you will transition from JavaScript ES5 to JavaScript ES6 along the way. I hope this book captures my enthusiasm for React and JavaScript and helps you to get started.

**[Muhammad Kashif](https://twitter.com/appsdevpk/status/848625244956901376):** "The Road to Learn React is a unique book that I recommend to any student or professional interested in learning react basics to advanced level. It is packed with insightful tips and techniques that are hard to find elsewhere, and remarkably thorough in its use of examples and references to sample problems, i have 17 years of experience in web and desktop app development, and before reading this book i was having trouble in learning react, but this book works like magic."

**[Andre Vargas](https://twitter.com/andrevar66/status/853789166987038720):** "The Road to Learn React by Robin Wieruch is such an awesome book! Most of what I learned about React and even ES6 was through it!"

**[Nicholas Hunt-Walker, Instructor of Python at a Seattle Coding School](https://twitter.com/nhuntwalker/status/845730837823840256):** "This is one of the most well-written & informative coding books I've ever worked through. A solid React & ES6 introduction."

**[Austin Green](https://twitter.com/AustinGreen/status/845321540627521536):** "Thanks, really loved the book. Perfect blend to learn React, ES6, and higher level programming concepts."

**[Nicole Ferguson](https://twitter.com/nicoleffe/status/833488391148822528):** "I'm doing Robin's Road to Learn React course this weekend & I almost feel guilty for having so much fun."

**[Karan](https://twitter.com/kvss1992/status/889197346344493056):** "Just finished your Road to React. Best book for a beginner in the world of React and JS. Elegant exposure to ES. Kudos! :)"

**[Eric Priou](https://twitter.com/erixtekila/status/840875459730657283):** "The Road to learn React by Robin Wieruch is a must read. Clean and concise for React and JavaScript."

**A Rookie Developer:** "I just finished the book as a rookie developer, thanks for working on this. It was easy to follow and I feel confident in starting a new app from scratch in the coming days. The book was much better than official React.js tutorial that I tried earlier (and couldn't complete due to lack of detail). The exercises at the end of each section were very rewarding."

**Student:** "The best book to start learning ReactJS. The project moves along with the concepts being learnt which helps to grasp the subject. I have found 'Code and learn' as best way to master programming and this book exactly does that."

**[Thomas Lockney](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1880673388):** "Pretty solid introduction to React that doesn't try to be comprehensive. I just wanted a taste to understand what it was about and this book gave me exactly that. I didn't follow all the little footnotes to learn about the new ES6 features I've missed ("I wouldn't say I've been missing it, Bob."). But I'm sure for those of you who have fallen behind and are diligent about following those, you can probably learn a lot more than just what the book teaches."

{{% chapter_header "FAQ" "faq" %}}

**How do I get updates?** You can [subscribe](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/rwieruch) to the Newsletter or follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rwieruch) for updates. Once you have a copy of the book, it will stay updated when a new edition gets released. But you have to grab the copy again when an update is announced.

**Does it use the recent React version?** The book always receives an update when the React version got updated. Usually books are outdated pretty soon after their release. Since this book is self-published, I can update it whenever I want.

**Does it cover Redux?** It doesn't. Therefore I have written a second book. The Road to learn React should give you a solid foundation before you dive into advanced topics. The implementation of the sample application in the book will show that you don't need Redux to build an application in React. After you have read the book, you should be able to implement a solid application without Redux. Then you can read my second book to learn [Redux](https://roadtoreact.com/course-details?courseId=TAMING_THE_STATE).

**Does it use JavaScript ES6?** Yes. But don't worry. You will be fine if you are familiar with JavaScript ES5. All JavaScript ES6 features, that I describe on the journey to learn React, will transition from ES5 to ES6 in the book. Every feature along the way will be explained. The book does not only teach React, but also all useful JavaScript ES6 features for React.

**Will you add more chapters in the future?** You can have a look at the Change Log chapter for major updates that already happened. There will be unannounced improvements in between too. In general, it depends on the community whether I continue to work on the book. If there is an acceptance for the book, I will deliver more chapters and improve the old material. I will keep the content up to date with recent best practices, concepts and patterns.

**What are the reading formats?** In addition to the .pdf, .epub, and .mobi formats, you can read it in pure markdown on GitHub. In general, I recommend reading it on a suitable format, otherwise the code snippets will have ugly line breaks.

**How can I get help while reading the book?** The book has a [Slack Group](https://slack-the-road-to-learn-react.wieruch.com/) for people who are reading the book. You can join the channel to get help or to help others. After all, helping others can improve your learnings too.

**Why is the book pay what you want?** I have put a lot of effort into this and will do so in the future. My desire is to reach as many people as possible. Everyone should be enabled to learn React. Still you could pay, if you can afford it. In addition, the [book attempts to support projects that educate children in the developing world](https://www.robinwieruch.de/giving-back-by-learning-react/). You can have an impact too.

**Can I support the project?** Yes. Feel free to reach out. I invest a lot of my time into open source tutorials and learning resources. You can have a look at my [about me](https://www.robinwieruch.de/about/) page. I would love to have you as my [Patron on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/rwieruch).

**Is there a call to action?** Yes. I want you to take a moment to think about a person who would be a good match to learn React. The person could have shown the interest already, could be in the middle of learning React or might not yet be aware about wanting to learn React. Reach out to that person and share the book. It would mean a lot to me. The book is intended to be given to others.

{{% chapter_header "What did people build after they have read the book?" "build-after" %}}

I encourage developers to reach out after they have finished the book and build their first React applications. The following are an excerpt of projects. Reach out to showcase your applications!

* {{% a_blank "Hacker News App with improved Design" "https://frozen-waters-31575.herokuapp.com" %}}

{{% chapter_header "Education for Children" "educateChildren" %}}

The book is open source and should enable everyone to learn React. However, not everyone is privileged to use open source resources, because not everyone is educated in the English language in the first place. Even though the book is pay what you want, I want to use it to support projects that teach children English in the developing world.

{{% chapter_header "Finished the Book? My Recommendations" "learningPaths" %}}

My recommended learning paths (extracted from the book) after you have read the book:

* **State Management:** You have used React `this.setState()` and `this.state` to manage and access local component state. That's a perfect start. However, in a larger application you will experience the [limits of React's local component state](https://www.robinwieruch.de/learn-react-before-using-redux/). Therefore you can use a third-party state management library such as [Redux or MobX](https://www.robinwieruch.de/redux-mobx-confusion/). On the course platform [Road to React](https://roadtoreact.com/), you will find the course "Taming the State in React" that teaches advanced local state in React, Redux and MobX. The course comes with an ebook as well, but I recommend everyone to dive into the source code and screencasts too. If you liked this book, you should definitely checkout Taming the State in React.

* **Sample Projects:** After learning plain React, it is always good to apply the learnings first in your own projects before learning something new. You could write your own tic-tac-toe game or a simple calculator in React. There are plenty of tutorials out there that use only React to build something exciting. Check out mine about building [a paginated and infinite scrolling list](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-paginated-list/), [showcasing tweets on a Twitter wall](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-svg-patterns/) or [connecting your React application to Stripe for charging money](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-express-stripe-payment/). Experiment with these mini applications to get comfortable in React.

* **Code Organization:** On your way reading the book you came across one chapter about code organization. You could apply these changes now, if you haven't done it yet. It will organize your components in structured files and folders (modules). In addition, it helps to understand and learn the principles of code splitting, reusability, maintainability and module API design.

* **Testing:** The book only scratched the surface of testing. If you are not familiar with the general topic, you could dive deeper into the concepts of unit testing and integration testing, especially in context of React applications. On an implementation level, I would recommend to stick to Enzyme and Jest in order to refine your approach of testing with unit tests and snapshot tests in React.

* **Asynchronous Requests:** You can substitute the native fetch API with third-party alternatives to perform asynchronous requests: [superagent](https://github.com/visionmedia/superagent) or [axios](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios). There is no perfect solution to make asynchronous requests. But by exchanging the buildings blocks around React, you make the experience [how powerful it can be to have this flexibility](https://www.robinwieruch.de/reasons-why-i-moved-from-angular-to-react/). In frameworks you usually stick to one solution. In a [flexible ecosystem like React](https://www.robinwieruch.de/essential-react-libraries-framework/) you can exchange the solutions.

* **Routing:** You can implement routing for your application with [react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router). So far, you only have one page in your application. React Router helps you to have multiple pages across multiple URLs. When you introduce routing to your application, you don't make any requests to your web server to fetch the next page. The router will do everything for you on the client-side.

* **Type Checking:** In one chapter, you have used React PropTypes to define component interfaces. It is a good practice to prevent bugs. But the PropTypes are only checked on runtime. You can go one step further to introduce static type checking on compile time. [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is one popular approach. But in the React ecosystem, people often use [Flow](https://flowtype.org/). I can recommend to give Flow a shot if you are interested to make your application more robust.

* **Tooling with Webpack and Babel:** In the book you have used *create-react-app* to set up your application. At some point, when you have learned React, you might want to learn the tooling around it. It enables you to setup your own project without *create-react-app*. I can recommend to follow a minimal setup with [Webpack and Babel](https://www.robinwieruch.de/minimal-react-webpack-babel-setup/). Afterward you can apply more tooling on your own. For instance, you could [use ESLint](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-eslint-webpack-babel/) to follow a unified code style in your application.

* **React Native:** [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) brings your application on mobile devices. You can apply your learnings from React to ship iOS and Android applications. The learning curve, once you have learned React, shouldn't be steep in React Native. Both share the same principles. You will only encounter different layout components on mobile than you are used to in web applications.

<hr class="section-divider">

Now you should know everything what you can expect from the book. You can pay what you want, because I want to enable everyone to learn React. I would really appreciate your support on social media to reach as many people as possible to grab a version of the book.
