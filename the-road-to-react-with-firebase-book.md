Today I am thrilled to announce The Road to React with Firebase. What I started as tutorial in 2017 matured into an entire book with course material in late 2018. The tutorial is one of my most read articles on my website, well-received by everyone who went through it, so I thought to release it as full-blown book by adding plenty of content to it.

I wrote the book because I have been using React and Firebase as minimal tech stack myself for a while now. It powers my business applications with just these two technologies and I heard several success stories from people using my tutorial as foundation to power their businesses as well. I wanted to give more people the opportunity to get started on realizing their ideas by mastering this minimal tech stack.

The best thing about the book: I **release it for free**. I think everyone should have the chance to learn Firebase, because it enables you to build full-fledged applications. The second best thing about the book is that I self-published it, which means it will be updated as often as possible, and that I can keep the PDF, EPUB, or MOBI versions in a state of constant improvement.

I wrote the The Road to React with Firebase over the last two years. During this time, I came to understand the practical genius of Firebase, and how it dramatically reduces the tech stack to focus on getting sh*t done. Once you have set up your starter kit project -- that's what we are going to do together in this book -- you are ready to iterate fast on your personal ideas. There is no need to complicate things by adding backend application with a database to your frontend application, because Firebase takes care of it with a well-designed API.

TODO

The book comes with XXX pages, XX+ exercises and XXX+ code snippets and various source code applications if you decide to buy the complete course. I applied the same principles as for my other books:

* Stay pragmatic
* Keep it simple
* Answer the why, not just the how
* Experience a problem, solve a problem

This book is not intended to be an end-all reference for the Firebase API. Instead, its purpose is to journey through learning Firebase with React the pragmatic way, building an entire application on this tech stack yourself. The endresult is the foundation to make your business application a reality.

The book covers lots of facets about Firebase in React that are important for building modern applications. If you have just learned React for your frontend application, you may be in need to add a backend application to persist your data. Normally you would jump straight into full-stack development by setting up a backend application with a database yourself. However, many developers new to JavaScript find this step intimidating, because it comes with a lot of new tech choices and learnings.

Using Firebase instead takes all the pain away of building a backend application yourself. Firebase gives your application a real-time database, authentication, hosting and much more. You will learn about all these things yourself in the book by setting up a React application with user management, authorization based on permissions and roles, and other powerful features such as password resets, email verification and social logins via Facebook/Google/Twitter. It's the perfect starter kit to get you started with your MVP.

I hope "The Road to React with Firebase" captures my enthusiasm for the topic, and that it becomes a valuable resource among other courses, tutorials, and books on the pragmatic use of Firebase for web applications. As always, feedback through any of the available platforms is welcome and encouraged!
