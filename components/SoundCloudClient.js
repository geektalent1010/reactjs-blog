    <p>
      If you donâ€™t have the outcome of <a href="http://www.robinwieruch.de/the-soundcloud-client-in-react-redux/">The SoundCloud Client in React + Redux</a>, checkout this <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/rwieruch/react-redux-soundcloud">repository</a>. Clone the repository and use the Base folder named base-init/ as seed project. The seed project is the same which you would implement when you would step through the <a href="http://www.robinwieruch.de/the-soundcloud-client-in-react-redux/">initial tutorial</a>. Next to the Base folder you will find several Extension folders, which will show the outcome of each tutorial which builds up on The SoundCloud Client in React + Redux.
