Today, I am super happy to announce the release of *The Road to GraphQL - Your journey to master pragmatic GraphQL in JavaScript*. It was tough writing it, with GraphQL technologies changing all the time, but finally the up-to-date version is there.

Probably the best thing about it: **It is for free.** In my opinion, everyone should have the chance to learn about GraphQL. I believe GraphQL will change how we think about client-server communication and data management in applications in the future, so everyone should get a chance to learn it.

The second best thing about the book: **I self-published it and will update it whenever I can.** GraphQL is a fairly new technology and there are new things coming up every day. That means once you got your ebook as PDF, EPUB, or MOBI, you always have the chance to download the most recent version of it.

I wrote the *The Road to GraphQL* over the last year while building several GraphQL applications for myself and clients of mine. During this time, I noticed the beauty of GraphQL and how **it dramatically improves the communication for client-server architectures**. Not only does it improve the interface between these two entities, but also the state management on the client-side application by taking away all the remote data management. By using sophisticated GraphQL libraries such as Apollo Client, you get **powerful features like caching, optimistic UI and prefetching of data** for free. The book goes into GraphQL itself, but also guides you through its ecosystem.

I applied the same principles as for my other books:

* stay pragmatic
* keep it simple
* answer the why and not only the how
* experience a problem, solve a problem

The book about GraphQL is not intended to be a reference for GraphQL APIs nor an in-depth guide about the internals of the GraphQL specification. Instead, it takes you on a journey learning GraphQL with JavaScript the pragmatic way by building client- and server-side applications yourself. **The book covers lots of facets about GraphQL in JavaScript which are important for building modern applications nowadays.** It doesn't throw all the libraries (e.g. Apollo) for solving problems before experiencing the problems in the first place. That's why you will start with basic HTTP requests to perform first GraphQL queries before using a dedicated GraphQL library for it. You will even get the chance to implement your own GraphQL client library in order to understand how such libraries work under the hood. So there are no hidden abstractions in this book, but lots of fundamentals about JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, and of course GraphQL.

{{% sub_chapter_header "Client-side GraphQL with React" "graphql-book-client-react" %}}

The first larger block of the book starts out with teaching how to build a GraphQL client application in React. That's why React is required knowledge for reading this book and therefore you should take a look at my other free book called "The Road to learn React". At some point in the GraphQL book, you will see that it becomes tedious to perform every GraphQL operation with basic HTTP requests. That's the point when you will swap the basic HTTP implementation with Apollo Client. While building your next application with Apollo Client, you will learn more advanced features such as caching, optimistic UI and pagination with Apollo in React. In the end, you will have a fully running GraphQL client application.

{{% sub_chapter_header "Server-side GraphQL with Node" "graphql-book-client-node" %}}

The second larger block of the book continues with implementing your own GraphQL server application with Express.js and Apollo Server in Node.js. There you will not only learn about all the GraphQL server-side topics, but also how they can be applied in context in a real world server application which offers pagination, authentication, role- and permission-based authorization, batching, caching, subscriptions, and a SQL database. The GraphQL server topics are not only about GraphQL, but also about using GraphQL in context of other JavaScript technologies to build powerful real world applications with it. In the end, you will have a running GraphQL server project which has all the mentioned features and can be used to realize your own ideas on top of it.

<hr class="section-divider">

After all, the book should teach you everything that's needed for building modern JavaScript applications with GraphQL. In the future, I am looking forward to extend the book with other technologies and new features from the GraphQL specification. I want to keep a high quality and try to make it the best GraphQL book out there. I hope that "The Road to GraphQL" captures my enthusiasm for the topic and becomes a valuable resource among other courses, tutorials, and books on GraphQL for you to learn everything about GraphQL the pragmatic way! I would be so happy about your feedback.
